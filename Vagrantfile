	# 
	# This box is provided directly by Canonical and is updated almost nightly. Currently it is

	# Default Box IP Address
	#
	# This is the IP address that your host will communicate to the guest through. In the
	# case of the default `192.168.56.101` that we've provided, Virtualbox will setup another
	# network adapter on your host machine with the IP `192.168.13.1` as a gateway.
	#
	# If you are already on a network using the 192.168.13.x subnet, this should be changed.
	# If you are running more than one VM through Virtualbox, different subnets should be used
	# for those as well. This includes other Vagrant boxes.

	# Local Machine Hosts
	#
	# If the Vagrant plugin hostsupdater (https://github.com/cogitatio/vagrant-hostsupdater) is

	# be aware of the domains specified below. Watch the provisioning script as you may be
	# required to enter a password for Vagrant to access your hosts file.

	# Drive mapping
	#
	# The following config.vm.share_folder settings will map directories in your Vagrant
	# virtual machine to directories on your local machine. Once these are mapped, any
	# changes made to the files in these directories will affect both the local and virtual
	# machine versions. Think of it as two different ways to access the same file. When the
	# virtual machine is destroyed with `vagrant destroy`, your files will remain in your local
	# environment.

	# /var/www/
	# 
	# For each project you're working on map a folder to it. The first argument is the location
	# on the host computer. The second argument is the location on the guest matching. Finally the 
	# 3rd arguement is a unique ID given to each folder mapped

	# Provisioning
	#
